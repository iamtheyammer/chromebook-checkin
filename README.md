# chromebook-checkin
Help check-in chromebooks and chargers along with adding a note.

## Install
1. Open a Google Spreadsheet, go to Tools -> Script Editor, and paste in [Code.gs](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/chromebook-checkin/blob/master/Code.gs).  
2. Then, on the toolbar, under 'Select a function', select 'onOpen'. It will tell you to save the script, then name it.  
3. Go back to the script editor and press the play button. This time it will ask you for permissions. Approve them.
4. Set the settings at the top of the checkIn function.
5. Save the document.
6. Close the script editor.
7. Reload your spreadsheet.
8. On the menubar of your sheet, you'll see 'Chromebook Check-In'. Click on then press start.
